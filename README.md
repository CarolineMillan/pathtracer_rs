# rusty_raytracer

This is a path tracer, written in Rust, that I made from following the tutorial [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). I started a separate repository for the second book in the series, [_Ray Tracing: The Next Week_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheNextWeek.html).
