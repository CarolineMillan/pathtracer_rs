# rusty_raytracer

This is a path tracer, written in Rust, that I made from following the tutorial Ray Tracing in One Weekend
<a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html">
    <cite>Ray Tracing in One Weekend</cite>
</a>. I started a separate repository for the second book in the series, Ray Tracing in One Weekend: The Next Week [_Ray Tracing: The Next Week_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheNextWeek.html).
